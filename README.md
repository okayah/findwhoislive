# FindWhoisLive
Find streamers that are currently live from a json file.

# Installation:
Go to [releases](https://github.com/okayah/findwhoislive/releases/latest/) and download the latest release.

Unzip the file into a directory of your choice.
After unzipping you want to open ``setup.bat``, this will download what you need for the program to run.
Configure ``config.json`` and ``streamers.json`` to your liking then use ``run.bat``.
